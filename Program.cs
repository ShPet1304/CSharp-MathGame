/* Math Game Requirements
- You need to create a game that consists of asking the player what's the result of a math question
 (i.e. 9 x 9 = ?), collecting the input and adding a point in case of a correct answer.

- A game needs to have at least 5 questions.

-The divisions should result on INTEGERS ONLY and dividends should go from 0 to 100. Example: Your app shouldn't present the division 7/2 to the user, 
 since it doesn't result in an integer.

- Users should be presented with a menu to choose an operation.

- You should record previous games in a List and there should be an option in the 
  menu for the user to visualize a history of previous games.

- You don't need to record results on a database. 
  Once the program is closed the results will be deleted.*/
